        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "If X is truthful, Y is a liar, making Y's statement false, so Z is not a truth-teller. Z's statement would then be false, implying X and Y are of different types, which contradicts X being truthful and Y being a liar. If Y is truthful, Z is a truth-teller, making Z's statement true, implying X and Y are the same type, contradicting Y being truthful and X being a liar. If Z is truthful, X and Y are same type, but X's statement would make Y a liar, contradicting Z's statement. No consistent configuration exists with exactly one truth-teller."

        "explanation": "Ravi's maternal grandmother's only brother is Ravi's maternal uncle. His daughter is Ravi's maternal aunt. Ravi's paternal grandfather's only son is Ravi's father. Thus, Ravi's paternal grandfather's son is Ravi's father, making the daughter of Ravi's maternal grandmother's only brother Ravi's maternal aunt.

But this contradicts the condition that only one is a truth-teller. If Y is the truth-teller, then Z is a truth-teller, contradicting the condition. If X is the truth-teller, then Y is a liar, making Y's statement false (so Z is not a truth-teller), but Z's statement would then be true, making Z a truth-teller.
