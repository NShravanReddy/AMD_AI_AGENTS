F is between G and H, both facing outward. Since E faces outward and is adjacent to D, and D is opposite A, the only person between F and G is B."

If P is a liar, then Q is a truth-teller. If Q is a truth-teller, then R is a truth-teller. If R is a truth-teller, then P is a liar, which is consistent. Thus, Q and R are truth-tellers, making the answer B (1 truth-teller)."

If R is the truth-teller, then P is a liar, making Q a truth-teller (contradiction). Thus, none can be the truth-teller if exactly one is. Therefore, the correct answer is D."

Thus, X must be a liar. If X is a liar, then Y is not a liar, so Y is a truth-teller. If Y is a truth-teller, then Z is a truth-teller.

If Z is a liar, then X and Y are not of the same type, which is consistent because X is a truth-teller and Y is a liar. Thus, only X is a truth-teller. If X were a liar, then Y is a truth-teller, which would make Z a truth-teller, contradicting Z's statement. Hence, only one truth-teller exists."

If P is the truth-teller, then Q is a liar, making R a truth-teller, again contradicting the condition. If R is the truth-teller, then P is a liar, making Q a truth-teller, which also contradicts the condition. Thus, none can be the truth-teller, making D correct. However, the correct answer is B because if Q is the truth-teller, then R is a truth-teller, which contradicts the condition. Therefore, the correct answer is B."

B's statement that C is a truth-teller would be false, making B a liar. C's statement that D is a liar would also be false, making C a liar.
