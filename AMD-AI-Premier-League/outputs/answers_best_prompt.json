        "reasoning": "Ravi is the only son of Arun's father's only sister, making Ravi Arun's cousin. Arun is the son of Ravi's maternal grandfather's only daughter, confirming Ravi is Arun's cousin. Thus, Ravi is related to Arun's mother as a cousin."

        "answer": "C",
        "reasoning": "Assume C is the knight. Then C's statement 'A is a knight if and only if B is a knave' must be true. If A is a knight, B must be a knave, and vice versa. If A is a knight, then A's statement 'B is a knight and C is a knave' is false, which contradicts A being a knight. If B is a knight, B's statement 'A is a knave or C is a knight' is true, which is consistent. Thus, C being the knight satisfies all conditions with exactly one knight."

X's statement 'Y is a knave and Z is a knight' would be true if Y is a knave and Z is a knight, but since X is a knave, this statement must be false. Y's statement 'X is a knight and Z is a knave' would also be false if X is a knave and Z is a knight. Thus, only Z is a knight, satisfying the condition of exactly one knight."

        "reasoning": "If Cael is the knight, his statement 'Alaric is a knave or Bryn is a knight' is true. Since exactly one is a knight, Alaric and Bryn must be knaves. Alaric's statement 'Bryn is a knight and Cael is a knave' is false, which is consistent with him being a knave. Bryn's statement 'Cael is a knight' is false, consistent with him being a knave. Thus, Cael is the only knight."

Alpha's statement 'Beta is a knave and Gamma is a knight' would be true, contradicting Alpha being a knave. Beta's statement 'Gamma is a knave or Alpha is a knight' would be false, consistent with Beta being a knave. Thus, Gamma is the only knight."

If Milo is a knave, his statement 'Nora is a knave and Otto is a knight' is false, which is consistent. If Nora is a knight, her statement 'Milo is a knight and Otto is a knave' is false, which is also consistent. Only Otto is a knight, satisfying the condition."

If Milo is a knave, his statement 'Nora is a knave and Owen is a knight' is false. This means either Nora is not a knave or Owen is not a knight. Since Owen is a knight, Nora must be a knight. Nora's statement 'Milo is a knight or Owen is a knave' is true because Owen is a knight. Thus, only Owen is a knight."

        "reasoning": "Given the seating arrangement, A is two seats to the left of B, and F is between A and C. Since B is facing the center, the opposite of A would be B. D is opposite E, but this does not affect A's opposite. Thus, B is the correct answer."

        "answer": "B",
        "reasoning": "Given A is opposite D, and E faces the same direction as D, E must be opposite A. B is two seats to the left of E, so B is two seats left of A. C is adjacent to F and faces the same direction as B, so F is adjacent to C. Since F is not adjacent to A, the person between A and D is B."

        "reasoning": "Assume Owen is the knight. Then his statement 'Nora is a knave and Milo is a knight' must be true. This makes Nora a knave and Milo a knight. But Milo's statement 'Nora is a knight and Owen is a knave' would then be false, which is consistent with Milo being a knight (as knights tell the truth). Nora's statement 'Milo is a knave or Owen is a knight' is true because Owen is a knight, but since Nora is a knave, she must be lying. This fits the condition of exactly one knight (Owen)."

        "reasoning": "Given the circular arrangement, we know A is opposite B. C is two seats left of D, and D is adjacent to E. F is between G and H, and G is opposite I. Since E is not adjacent to A, the only person directly opposite F is D. This is determined by placing all individuals in the circle based on the given constraints and checking the opposite positions."
