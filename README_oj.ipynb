Ravi's paternal grandfather's only daughter is Ramesh's mother. Ramesh's only daughter is Ravi's cousin. Thus, Ravi is the cousin of Ramesh's only daughter.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': 'From the clues, J is three seats to the left of A, so A is three seats to the right of J. Since there are nine seats, the person directly opposite A would be three seats away in the other direction. Given A is between B and C, B is directly opposite A.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'D', 'reasoning': 'We know A is between B and C, so A is adjacent to B and C. D is two seats to the right of E. F is directly opposite G. H is adjacent to I, who is not adjacent to A. J has two people between him and B. By analyzing the positions and constraints, D is directly opposite A.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'D', 'reasoning': 'Given A is opposite B, and B is between C and D, the order around the table is C, B, D. F is two seats to the right of A, and E is adjacent to F. Placing A and B opposite each other, with C and D on either side of B, F must be two seats to the right of A, making D adjacent to A.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': \"J is the daughter of I, who is the brother of H. H's mother is G, who is the mother of F. A is the father of B, who is the daughter of C. D is the brother of C, and E is the daughter of D. Therefore, J is the granddaughter of A through the lineage of C, D, E, F, G, H, and I.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': \"Ravi is the only son of Arun's father's only sister, making Ravi Arun's cousin. Arun is the son of Ravi's maternal grandfather's only daughter, confirming Ravi is Arun's cousin. Thus, Ravi is related to Arun's mother as a cousin.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"Assume C is the knight. Then C's statement 'A is a knight if and only if B is a knave' must be true. If A is a knight, B must be a knave, and vice versa. If A is a knight, then A's statement 'B is a knight and C is a knave' is false, which contradicts A being a knight. If B is a knight, B's statement 'A is a knave or C is a knight' is true, which is consistent. Thus, C being the knight satisfies all conditions with exactly one knight.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"If Z is the knight, then his statement 'X is a knave or Y is a knight' is true. Assuming Z is a knight, X and Y must be knaves. X's statement 'Y is a knave and Z is a knight' would be true if Y is a knave and Z is a knight, but since X is a knave, this statement must be false. Y's statement 'X is a knight and Z is a knave' would also be false if X is a knave and Z is a knight. Thus, only Z is a knight, satisfying the condition of exactly one knight.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"If Cael is the knight, his statement 'Alaric is a knave or Bryn is a knight' is true. Since exactly one is a knight, Alaric and Bryn must be knaves. Alaric's statement 'Bryn is a knight and Cael is a knave' is false, which is consistent with him being a knave. Bryn's statement 'Cael is a knight' is false, consistent with him being a knave. Thus, Cael is the only knight.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"Assume Gamma is the knight. Then Gamma's statement 'Alpha is a knave if and only if Beta is a knight' must be true. If Gamma is a knight, Alpha and Beta must be knaves. Alpha's statement 'Beta is a knave and Gamma is a knight' would be true, contradicting Alpha being a knave. Beta's statement 'Gamma is a knave or Alpha is a knight' would be false, consistent with Beta being a knave. Thus, Gamma is the only knight.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': 'A is the brother of B, who is the daughter of C. J is the daughter of K, and I is the mother of J. I is the sister of H, who is the brother of G. Since A and H are brothers, A is the uncle of J.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"Assume Otto is the knight. Then his statement 'Milo is a knave or Nora is a knight' must be true. If Milo is a knave, his statement 'Nora is a knave and Otto is a knight' is false, which is consistent. If Nora is a knight, her statement 'Milo is a knight and Otto is a knave' is false, which is also consistent. Only Otto is a knight, satisfying the condition.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"Assume Owen is a knight. Then his statement 'Nora is a knight if and only if Milo is a knave' is true. If Milo is a knave, his statement 'Nora is a knave and Owen is a knight' is false. This means either Nora is not a knave or Owen is not a knight. Since Owen is a knight, Nora must be a knight. Nora's statement 'Milo is a knight or Owen is a knave' is true because Owen is a knight. Thus, only Owen is a knight.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': \"Anjali is the daughter of Ravi's paternal grandfather's only daughter, meaning Anjali is Ravi's aunt. Ravi is the son of Anjali's only brother, so Anjali's brother is Ravi's father. Therefore, Anjali is Ravi's aunt, making Ravi the nephew of Anjali's mother.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': \"Ravi is the son of Priya's father's only sister, making Ravi Priya's cousin. Priya is the daughter of Ravi's paternal grandfather's only daughter, confirming they are cousins. Thus, Ravi is Priya's cousin.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': \"Given the seating arrangement, A is two seats to the left of B, and F is between A and C. Since B is facing the center, the opposite of A would be B. D is opposite E, but this does not affect A's opposite. Thus, B is the correct answer.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': 'Given A is opposite D, and E faces the same direction as D, E must be opposite A. B is two seats to the left of E, so B is two seats left of A. C is adjacent to F and faces the same direction as B, so F is adjacent to C. Since F is not adjacent to A, the person between A and D is B.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'A', 'reasoning': \"Rajesh is the brother of Ravi, who is the son of Ramesh. Radha is the daughter of Ramesh's only sibling, making her Ramesh's niece. Since Rajesh is Ravi's brother, he is also Radha's cousin.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': \"Ramesh is the father of Ravi, so he is Ravi's father. Ravi's mother is Ramesh's wife. Ramesh is the brother of Ramesh's wife's father, making Ramesh the brother-in-law of Ravi's mother.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'D', 'reasoning': 'From the clues, J is between A and D, so A-J-D. D is two seats to the right of E, so E-D-F. F is opposite G. H is adjacent to I, who is not opposite J. Since there are 9 seats, opposite is 4 seats apart. I is not opposite J, so I must be opposite D. Thus, the answer is D.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"Assume Owen is the knight. Then his statement 'Nora is a knave and Milo is a knight' must be true. This makes Nora a knave and Milo a knight. But Milo's statement 'Nora is a knight and Owen is a knave' would then be false, which is consistent with Milo being a knight (as knights tell the truth). Nora's statement 'Milo is a knave or Owen is a knight' is true because Owen is a knight, but since Nora is a knave, she must be lying. This fits the condition of exactly one knight (Owen).\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'D', 'reasoning': 'Given the circular arrangement, we know A is opposite B. C is two seats left of D, and D is adjacent to E. F is between G and H, and G is opposite I. Since E is not adjacent to A, the only person directly opposite F is D. This is determined by placing all individuals in the circle based on the given constraints and checking the opposite positions.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"Assume Gamma is the knight. Then Gamma's statement 'Alpha is a knave if and only if Beta is a knight' must be true. If Gamma is a knight, Alpha and Beta must be knaves. Alpha's statement 'Beta is a knave and Gamma is a knight' would be true, contradicting Alpha being a knave.
