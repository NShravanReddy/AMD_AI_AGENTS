But A says 'B is a knight and C is a knave', which would be false if A is a knight, contradicting the assumption. If A is a knave, then B must be a knight. But B says 'A is a knave or C is a knight', which is true if A is a knave. This fits with C being a knight and exactly one knight. Thus, C is the knight."

D is the brother of C, making D the brother-in-law of A. H, being the brother of G, is the uncle of F and thus the uncle of A's family. Therefore, H is the uncle of A."

D is adjacent to E, who is two seats to the right of F. F is not adjacent to A. Placing the people in a circle, the only person between A and B is D."

If Alpha is a knave, his statement 'Beta is a knave and Gamma is a knight' is false, which is consistent. Beta's statement 'Alpha is a knight and Gamma is a knave' is also false, which is consistent. Thus, only Gamma is a knight, satisfying the condition of exactly one knight."

E is the daughter of D, F is the son of E, G is the daughter of F, and H is the son of G. Therefore, H is the nephew of F, who is the son of E, who is the daughter of D, who is the brother of C, who is the parent of B. Thus, H is the cousin of A."

However, C's statement 'A is a knave or B is a knight' would be false if A is a knight and B is a knave, making C a knave, contradicting the assumption. If B is a knight, then A is a knight and C is a knave, but this leads to contradictions. If C is a knight, then either A is a knave or B is a knight. This is consistent with exactly one knight (C), as A and B's statements would be false. Thus, C is the knight."

If Bella is a knave, her statement is true, which is a contradiction. If Cody is a knight, his statement 'Alaric is a knight if and only if Bella is a knave' is true, matching Alaric being a knave and Bella being a knave. Thus, only Cody is a knight.

Milo's statement 'Nora is a knave and Otto is a knight' would be false (as Nora is a knave and Otto is a knight, making the first part true but the second part true, so the whole statement is true, contradicting Milo being a knave). Nora's statement 'Milo is a knight and Otto is a knave' is false, which is consistent with her being a knave. Thus, Otto is the only knight."
