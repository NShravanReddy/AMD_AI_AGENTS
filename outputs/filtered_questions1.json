If P is a liar, then Q is not a liar, so Q is a truth-teller. If Q is a truth-teller, then R is a truth-teller. If R is a truth-teller, then P is a liar, which fits.

R says P is a liar, which would be a lie if R is a liar, but R's status is uncertain. If Q is truthful, then R is a truth-teller, contradicting R's statement. If R is truthful, then P is a liar, making P's statement false (so Q is not a liar), but Q's statement would be true, contradicting R's truthfulness.

If A is the truth-teller, then B is a liar, making C's statement true, which contradicts the one truth-teller rule. If C is the truth-teller, then A is a liar, making B's statement false, so B is a liar. This fits: only C is truthful, others are liars."

The family tree shows that A and J are on different branches of the tree, with A being the brother of B and J being the daughter of K. Since C and L are not related, A is not directly related to J.
