        "explanation": "Riya's only brother's mother = Riya's mother. Sonal is Riya's mother's sister, so Sonal is Riya's maternal aunt. Priya says Sonal is her aunt, so Priya and Riya are cousins. Rajesh is Riya's brother, but Priya is not his sister, so Rajesh and Priya are also cousins.",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Assume X is a truth-teller: then Y is a liar. Y's statement would be false, so Z and Y are not the same type, so Z is a truth-teller. But Z claims X is a truth-teller, which is consistent. This creates a contradiction. Try Y as truth-teller: Y says Z and Y are the same, so Z is a truth-teller. X says Y is a liar, so X is a liar. Z says X is a truth-teller, so contradiction. Try Z as truth-teller: Z says X is a truth-teller, so X is a truth-teller. X says Y is a liar, so Y is a liar. Y says Z and I are the same, but Y is a liar, so Z and Y are not the same, so Z is a truth-teller. This is consistent. But this matches the previous scenario, which is not possible. Thus, no solution fits, so D) None is correct.",
