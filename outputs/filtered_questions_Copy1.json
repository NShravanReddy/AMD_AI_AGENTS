        "explanation": "If X is a truth-teller, Y is a liar, so Y's statement that Z is a truth-teller is false, making Z a liar. Z's statement that X is a liar would then be true, contradicting Z being a liar. If X is a liar, Y is a truth-teller, so Z is a truth-teller. Z's statement that X is a liar is true, consistent with Z being a truth-teller. Thus, only Y and Z are truth-tellers, but this contradicts. Only one can be a truth-teller: Y, making X and Z liars."
